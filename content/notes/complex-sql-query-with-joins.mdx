Retrieve user information along with their last login time using a join:

```sql
SELECT users.name, users.email, logins.last_login
FROM users
JOIN logins ON users.id = logins.user_id
WHERE logins.last_login > '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY logins.last_login DESC;
```

This query retrieves users who have logged in after January 1st, 2023, with their most recent login.
