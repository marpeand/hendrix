Speed up data processing by parallelizing tasks using `concurrent.futures`:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

def square(x):
    return x * x

with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(square, range(10)))

print(results)
```

This will calculate the square of numbers in parallel, speeding up the process for larger datasets.
