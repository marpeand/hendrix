Docker is a tool that enables containerization, a method of packaging applications and their dependencies into isolated environments. This ensures consistency across development, testing, and production.

### Why Use Docker?

1. **Portability**: Containers run consistently across different environments.
2. **Isolation**: Separate applications from each other and the host system.
3. **Efficiency**: Lightweight and faster to start compared to virtual machines.

### Example: Dockerfile for a Python App

Hereâ€™s a simple Dockerfile to containerize a Python application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application files
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Getting Started

1. Install Docker.
   Build the image: docker build -t my-python-app .
   Run the container: docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-app

Docker streamlines workflows, making it an essential skill for modern developers.
