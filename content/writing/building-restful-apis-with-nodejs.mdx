RESTful APIs are the backbone of many web applications. With Node.js and Express.js, you can build efficient and scalable APIs quickly and effectively.

### Setting Up

Start by initializing your project and installing Express:

```bash
mkdir my-api
cd my-api
npm init -y
npm install express

Basic API Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a REST API with Express:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

// Sample endpoint
app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Welcome to the API!' });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### Key Features of Express APIs

- Routing: Define clear endpoints for different resources.
- Middleware: Add custom logic for processing requests.
- Scalability: Integrate with databases and external services.

By understanding the core principles and leveraging Node.js tools, you can create robust RESTful APIs for any application.
