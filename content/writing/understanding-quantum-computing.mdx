Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in entirely new ways. Unlike classical computers that use bits, quantum computers use **qubits**, which can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously thanks to superposition.

### Core Concepts of Quantum Computing

1. **Superposition**: Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
2. **Entanglement**: Qubits become interconnected, meaning the state of one affects the state of another, even across distances.
3. **Quantum Gates**: Perform operations on qubits, akin to classical logic gates.

### Potential Applications

Quantum computing promises breakthroughs in areas like:

- Drug discovery through molecule simulation.
- Optimization problems in logistics.
- Cryptography with unbreakable encryption methods.

Although still in its infancy, quantum computing is poised to redefine our technological landscape.
