Signal processing is a cornerstone of modern technology, enabling everything from high-quality audio streaming to advanced medical imaging. It involves analyzing, modifying, and synthesizing signals like sound, images, and electromagnetic waves.

### Key Techniques

1. **Fourier Transform**: Decomposes signals into their frequency components.
2. **Filtering**: Removes noise or enhances certain features in a signal.
3. **Sampling**: Converts continuous signals into discrete data.

### Everyday Applications

- Enhancing speech in phone calls.
- Compressing images and videos for storage.
- Detecting abnormalities in ECG signals.

Whether you're an engineer or just curious about the tech around you, signal processing is a field worth exploring for its immense practical impact.
