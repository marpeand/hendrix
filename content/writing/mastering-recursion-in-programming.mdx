Recursion is a powerful tool in programming where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It's particularly useful in tasks like tree traversal, combinatorial problems, and dynamic programming.

### Key Concepts of Recursion

1. **Base Case**: The condition under which recursion stops.
2. **Recursive Case**: The part of the function that reduces the problem.

### Example: Factorial Calculation

Hereâ€™s how recursion works in calculating the factorial of a number:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case
    return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive case

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

### When to Use Recursion

- When the problem can naturally be divided into similar subproblems.
  When an iterative solution becomes cumbersome or less readable.

Mastering recursion can make you a more versatile programmer, but always be cautious of stack overflow issues!
