Chaos theory studies systems that appear random but are governed by underlying patterns. Itâ€™s a field that blends mathematics, physics, and computer science to describe phenomena like weather patterns, population dynamics, and stock market fluctuations.

### Fundamental Concepts

1. **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions**: Small changes can lead to drastically different outcomes (the "butterfly effect").
2. **Fractals**: Complex, self-similar patterns found in chaotic systems.
3. **Attractors**: States toward which a system tends to evolve.

### Applications of Chaos Theory

- Predicting climate variations.
- Modeling financial markets.
- Understanding neural networks in AI.

By unveiling the structure in apparent randomness, chaos theory offers profound insights into the interconnectedness of the universe.
