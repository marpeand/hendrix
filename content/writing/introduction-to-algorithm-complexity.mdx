Big O notation helps us analyze the efficiency of algorithms by describing their time or space complexity. It allows developers to predict performance as input sizes grow.

### Common Complexities

1. **O(1)**: Constant time, unaffected by input size.
2. **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time, as seen in binary search.
3. **O(n)**: Linear time, common in simple loops.
4. **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time, seen in nested loops.

### Example: Linear Search

Hereâ€™s an example of O(n) complexity in Python:

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

numbers = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9]
print(linear_search(numbers, 7))  # Output: 2
```

### Optimizing Algorithms

- Use data structures like hash tables to reduce search times.
- Break down nested loops when possible to improve performance.

Understanding algorithm complexity is critical for building fast and scalable software solutions.
